# Tic Tac Toe



## How to play

The Tic Tac game i developed is pretty self explanitory.
In order to win the player need to get 3 "X's" or "O's" in a row. The player can win diagonaly, vertically or horizontaly.


Here is a link to a YouTube video that states the rule of the game in detail. https://youtu.be/5SdW0_wTX5c




# How did i develop this game?
Before i started working a project i spent a day researching and brainstorming ideas. 
After i created the basic HTML file with specific Id and Class then i started calling DOM elements on my JavaScript file.


Once all the necessary variables are created, i started working on their functions and inspecting if my script is working.


I created a class for the two players that will be playing the game. Throughout the game i ended up developing multiple functions for the game. 

However; i wasn't able to solve the automated assignment of values on time.
