# Tic Tac Toe



## How to play

The Tic Tac game i developed is pretty self explanitory.
In order to win the player need to get 3 "X's" or "O's" in a row. The player can win diagonaly, vertically or horizontaly.

Here is a link to a YouTube video that states the rule of the game in detail. https://youtu.be/5SdW0_wTX5c

# How did i develop this game?
Before i started working a project i spent a day researching and brainstorming ideas. 
After i created the basic HTML file with specific Id and Class then i started calling DOM elements on my JavaScript file.

once all the necessary variables are created, i started working on their functions and inspecting if my script is working.
